# concept _01 =  We can write string in three ways like in the below: 

a = 'Hadi'             #way number - 01
a = "Hadi"             # way number - 02
a = '''Hadi'''          # way number - 03

print(a)

# concept_01 = we can not change any character in existing string like str = "Hadi" we can not change the character a in Hadi
# For this problem solve to create new string

# string devided formate:

name = "Hadi"
'''
devide = name[index_start, index_end]
        this is included          this is not included 

        '''
devide = name[0:2]           # ekhane start hobe 0 theke and end hobe 1 e but 2 add hobe nh
character = name[0]
lenth = len(name)
print(devide, character, lenth)
