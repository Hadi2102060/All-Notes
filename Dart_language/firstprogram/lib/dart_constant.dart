/*

.................. Dart Constant.......................


constant is a keyword whose value cannot be changed after using it.


int a = 10; // variable
a = 20; // value can be changed and it is right way


But .......

const b =30; // constant
b =40 ; // value cannot be changed and it is wrong way
// Also constant variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.
// not support only declaration like  this (const int a)
